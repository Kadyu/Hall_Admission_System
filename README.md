# Hall_Admission_System

Hall Admission System is designed as a solution to handle the hall admission procedure for both the student and the university. It is an admission platform that accepts student applications to halls and automatically admits applications based on predefined rules and hall requirements. This system allows students to browse available halls and submit admission to their desired hall. Students can also check the status of their application to see if it is successful. The staff can update the information on existing halls and add new halls when needed. The staff can also view all applications in the hall and process all the applications automatically with the built-in application processing algorithm.
